//! # Introduction

//! To an experienced programmer who can [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM),
//! the best entry point of Rust documentation is
//! <https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable>.
//!
//! To learn something as broad and deep as Rust ecosystem, we might also want to turn R into W,
//! dive deep by writing our own
//! [doc-tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/write-documentation/documentation-tests.html),
//! [unit and integration tests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html).

//! assert_eq!("WTFM", "RTFM".replace("R", "W"));
//! ```
//!
//! Since the main source of the M in RTFM is from
//! <https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/index.html>
//! and <https://docs.rs/about>, we can learn to WTFM from them.
